description: >-
  an ecommerce girls fashion website, coded with some structures of ecommerce
  app. I built the website without some functions (React Hooks) that should
  enable the website to operate fully as a real-time marketing application. I
  hope the simplicity will aid beginners in coding with React, Styled-Component,
  @mui, flexbox, css and active nav Links.
