  I completed this site as a proof-of-concept for using Hugo for our
  documentation project at my position at BackOffice Associates (now Syniti).
  Hugo did not have a theme that met all of our needs, so I created my own theme
  using UIKit (https://getuikit.com/). The site is incomplete as I left the
  company before we were able to implement it.
