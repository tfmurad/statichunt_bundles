  I'm a motivated, hard-working and work-oriented person who finds joy in new
  challenges and keep an eye out for them everyday. Ability to work well as a
  team member and exceptional work ethic. Desire to work in a professionally
  enriched environment for a challenging position utilizing creativity and a
  true desire to actively contribute which may enrich my skills and provide new
  horizons of excellence and personal development. I'm a Computer Science
  graduate with an obsession with modern web technologies. I'm quite confident
  with Javascript, ES6, React, Angular and related technologies. Other than that
  I try to learn new techs everyday to grow my arsenal.
